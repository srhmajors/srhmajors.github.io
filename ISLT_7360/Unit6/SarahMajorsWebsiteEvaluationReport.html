<h2>Participants</h2>
	<div class="design"></div>
	
	<h3>HTML Developer</h3>
		<div class="design"></div>
	<p>Elizabeth, a classmate in ISLT 7360 Introduction to Web Development, reviewed the code of my pilot website.  She has created her 
		own pilot website during this class that has turned out very well.  She was the first and only person to comment on the 
		discussion board where I posted my pilot website link.  She did not find any errors in my code.</p>

	<h3>Observed User</h3>
		<div class="design"></div>	
	<p>My observed user was Anthony, he is a parent in the school district with a middle school son and so he was
		a perfect user to observe for my pilot website.  He has already had a student go through the middle school that I work at
		and he struggled knowing what was going on in her classes and how to best help her.  Anthony works in the corporate
		world in technology and accounting, he brings new ideas to fruition or helps others in the company do the same so he 
		is technology savvy.  He used 
		his Samsung Galazy S8 smartphone to view my pilot website in a Chrome web browser while on cellular data. I asked 
		Anthony to find some items on my website that most parents would be interested in.
		</p>

	<h3>User Testers</h3>
		<div class="design"></div>
	<p>My first user tester was Joshua, a classmate in ISLT 7360 Introduction to Web Development and a 3rd grade teacher.  Being
		a classroom teacher I knew that he would be able to provide helpful feedback on my website, he has many interactions with
		parents and students on a daily basis.  He used a HP ProBood Intel Core i5 7th Gen in a Chrome web browser using a cable
		modem 250MB/s internet connection to access my website.</p>
		
	<p>My second user tester was Mariah, a classmate in ISLT 7360 Introduction to Web Development and a 7th grade math
		teacher.  Being a middle school math teacher I knew that she could provide valuable insight into what parents and students
		need to be successful in class.  She used a Mac in a Chrome web browser using a cable modem to access my pilot website</p>

<p>All agreed that they liked the navigation being at the top and bottom of each page, it made getting back to the home page very quick and
	easy without a lot of extra scrolling.  They also agreed that all pages were clear about
	what page you were on because they were clearly labeled.  No one had any issues opening any of the links on my pilot website. One 
	user thought the text color with a purple background in the header was a little dull, everyone else had positive comments on the 
	colors used on the website.  </p>

<p>Almost everyone mentioned that the banner image is too busy and hard to read.  It was also mentioned by several evaluators that it 
	would be best if any links opened in a new window. The observed user, Anthony, had no issues viewing my website on his cell phone, however he did comment that it is not as fluid as most mobile
	sites.  One of the user testers, Joshua, mentioned that he liked my photo on the home page but that I did not list any of my 
	credentials or years of experience in teaching. One evaluator felt that my font was too small.</p>

<p> It was mentioned by more than one
		person that they thought my website would get repeat traffic due to the content on the site.  One person mentioned
		how much they liked the games and the other mentioned that the resources supplement their learning and ensures return 
		users.</p>

<!-- Use Cases -->

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
	<div class="design"></div>
<p>My original use cases that I planned for in my design document were:  </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Students who are struggling with the math concepts and need a review of the days lesson can go to the 
				website and watch a video explanation of the lesson. The hope is that review will help them to 
				complete their homework.</li>
			<li>Students who have free time in math class, another class or at home can use the resources and games to 
				increase their math skills. These can be used as review, enrichment, or as a way to practice/learn missing 
				concepts.</li>
			<li>Parents can use the website to review math material with or without their child to better help them with the homework. 
				Parents can also use the website to check what homework was assigned and when the next assessment is. I will include links to 
				both Schoology (LMS) and Infinite Campus (grades)</li>
		</ul>
<p>I supported these use cases by including links to resources that match the lesson I teach each day on the homework calendar.  There 
	are tips and resources to help prepare for quizzes and tests on the review page.  Additionally I included websites that offer 
	videos and practice for the concepts we are learning this year in math class located on the resources page.  For students who 
	want extension or review during free time or at home have plenty of options to choose from on the games page.  Parents are 
	supported with helpful information and links on the home page, homework page, resources page and the review page.  I was able 
	to support all of my use cases on my website.  </p>
<p>The main difference between my original envision for my website and what I created was that I do not incorporate goal setting and 
	data tracking into the website for students.  Right now we do that either on paper kept in individual binders or in OneNote.  I 
	also did not add links for Desmos or Geogebra, these are resources that I use in my classroom semi-regularly and post the sites 
	on the SMARTboard when needed, so it is not necessary to add to the website.  Another thing that I did not put on this website 
	is both a video of my teaching and a video of someone else teaching the same lesson for each day.  Most students do not use the 
	videos and I decided I would rather share my YouTube chanel with students rather than have to go in and update this on a daily 
	basis.  If I were to use this website for my actual math students I would embed my Google Calendar or Schoology Calendar so it 
	would update the information as I input it into the calendars.    </p>
<p>The main purpose of my website stayed the same, to help students be successful in 8th grade math and to provide support so parents 
	can help their students however they see fit.  I am happy with how my website turned out and feel it would be a great resource 
	for both students and parents!  </p>

<!-- Recommended/Planned Changes -->

<h2>Recommended/Planned Changes</h2>
	<div class="design"></div>

	<p>Based on the feedback that I have collected, I propose making the following changes.   </p>

	<h3>Enhancing Credibility</h3>
		<div class="design"></div>
		<ul>
		<li>I will list my educational background on the home page  </li>
		<li>I will list my years of teaching experience on the home page   </li>
		<li>Adding these credentials to my website will let students and parents know a little more about me and increase the 
			credibility of my website.  </li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3>External Links</h3>
		<div class="design"></div>
		<ul>
		<li>I will update my code so that external links will open in a new window.  This will make it easier for my users to 
			use my website as they will not be directed away from it and have to figure out how to get back to it.</li>
		<li>In order to change my external links I need to set the target attribute to target="_blank" on all links that I want
			to open in a new window.</li>
		<li>I will go through my website and add this target attribute and then test my website in two different web browsers to
			ensure it all works correctly.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3>Banner Image</h3>
		<div class="design"></div>
		<ul>
		<li>I will work on my banner image to make it clearer and easier to read.   </li>
		<li> Having my banner be more clear and easier to read will take away a distraction on my website.  I don't want students
			or parents to have to struggle reading my banner.</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h3>Changes I am not making and reasons why</h3>
		<div class="design"></div>
		<ul>
		<li>Font size - only one person mentioned the font size as being too small.  I do not believe my font size is too small,
			it is the same size as most other websites so I am not making my font size any larger.</li>
		<li>Header colors - I put all colors of my website through  <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">Web 
			Aim's</a> color contrast checker and they all passed. So I can appreciate that one user did not prefer the color
			but it is readable and so I am going to leave it as it is.  </li>
		</ul>
		
		
<!-- Reflection on Evaluation Process -->

<h2>Reflection of Evaluation Process</h2>
	<div class="design"></div>

<p> It was nice having several different ways to evaluate my piot website: observation, interviews, surveys with users-testers, 
	experienced developer’s testing.  Each evaluation method brought up new points of discussion and ideas for improvement that 
		doing only one kind of evaluation might have missed.  Being able to see an end user go through my website trying to find
		certain items was eye opening to me.  The path that I had in my head was different then the path they took and understanding
		that and ensuring you have more then one way to get around your site is key.  Surveys with user testers were very useful
		in getting solid constructive feedback to improve my site.  They were able to address all questions in the website evaluation
		form to provide an in depth look at my site.  Having a class mate who is familiar with HTML go through my code was beneficial 
		to ensure everything looked and I was not missing or duplicating anything.  </p>
<p> I was scared to death of this assignment at the begining of the semester but like anything the more you practice and study the better
		you get and coding is no different.  I am glad we had all of the additional smaller assignments first to practice the basics
		and kept adding on to what we already learned.  The videos were very helpful at the begining of each module!  This assignment
		reminded me of hard some students think math is and that it is easy to just put it off because it is hard and not do the work 
		necessary to succeed.  But everyone is capable of learning when they put forth the effort.  I am so excited and proud of my very
		own self coded website!</p>
