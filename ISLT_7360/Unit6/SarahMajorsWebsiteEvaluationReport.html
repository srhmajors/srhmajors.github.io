<h2>Participants</h2>
	<div class="design"></div>
	
	<h3>HTML Developer</h3>
		<div class="design"></div>
	<p>Elizabeth, a classmate in ISLT 7360 Introduction to Web Development, reviewed the code of my pilot website.  She did not
		find any errors in my code.</p>

	<h3>Observed User</h3>
		<div class="design"></div>	
	<p>My observed user was Anthony, he is a parent in the school district with a middle school son and so he was
		a perfect user to observe for my pilot website.  He has already had a student go through the middle school that I work out
		and he struggled knowing what was going on in her classes and how to best help her.  Anthony works in the corporate
		world in technology and accounting, he brings new ideas to fruition or helps others in the company do the same.  He used 
		his Samsung Galazy S8 smartphone to view my pilot website in a Chrome web browser while on cellular data. I asked 
		Anthony to find some items on my website that most parents would be interested in.
		</p>

	<h3>User Testers</h3>
		<div class="design"></div>
	<p>My first user tester was Joshua, a classmate in ISLT 7360 Introduction to Web Development and a 3rd grade teacher.  Being
		a classroom teacher I knew that he would be able to provide helpful feedback on my website, he has many interactions with
		parents and students on a daily basis.  He used a HP ProBood Intel Core i5 7th Gen in a Chrome web browser using a cable
		modem 250MB/s internet connection to access my website.</p>
		
	<p>My second user tester was Mariah, a classmate in ISLT 7360 Introduction to Web Development and a 7th grade math
		teacher.  Being a middle school math teacher I knew that she could provide valuable insight into what parents and students
		need to be successful in class.  She used a Mac in a Chrome web browser using a cable modem to access my pilot website</p>

<p>All agreed that they liked the navigation being at the top and bottom of each page.  They also agreed that all pages were clear about
	what page you were on because they were clearly labeled.  No one had any issues opening any of the links on my pilot website. One 
	user thought the text color with a purple background in the header was a little dull, everyone else had positive comments on the 
	colors used on the website.  </p>

<p>All most everyone mentioned that the banner image is too busy and hard to read.  It was also mentioned by several evaluators that it 
	would be best if any links opened in a new window.  </p>

<p>The observed user, Anthony, had no issues viewing my website on his cell phone, however he did comment that it is not as fluid as most mobile
	sites.  One of the user testers, Joshua, mentioned that he like my photo on the home page but that I did not list any of my 
	credentials or years of experience in teaching.  </p>

<!-- Recommended/Planned Changes -->

<h2>Recommended/Planned Changes</h2>
	<div class="design"></div>

	<p>Based on the feedback that I have collected, I propose making the following changes.   </p>

	<h3>Enhancing Credibility</h3>
		<div class="design"></div>
		<ul>
		<li>I will list my educational background on the home page  </li>
		<li>I will list my years of teaching experience on the home page   </li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3>External Links</h3>
		<div class="design"></div>
		<ul>
		<li>I will update my code so that external links will open in a new window.  This will make it easier for my users to 
			use my website as they will not be directed away from it and have to figure out how to get back to it.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3>Banner Image</h3>
		<div class="design"></div>
		<ul>
		<li>I will work on my banner image to make it clearer and easier to read.   </li>
		</ul>
	
	<h3>Change 4</h3>
		<div class="design"></div>
		<ul>
		<li>   </li>
		<li>   </li>
		<li>   </li>
		</ul>
