	 <p>Welcome to Mrs. Majors 8th grade math class!  </p>
		 <p> I look forward to learing with you this year as we explore the <a href="https://www.parkhill.k12.mo.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_62416/File/Academic%20Services/Board%20Approved%20Curriculum/6-12%20Mathematics/Revisions%20Spring%202017/8thGradeMathematics--Board%20Approved%20May%2011,%202017.pdf">8th grade math curriculum</a>. You will need a spiral notebook, pencil and your laptop for every class.  8th grade math will prepare you for Algebra 1A in high school.  It is a much more rigorous curriculum than 7th grade.  You will have homework almost every night.  We will spend the first few days getting to know each other and building a community of math learners.  It is important to me to create a safe learning environment for all students as we will be making a lot of mistakes as we learn.  I will reinforce the fact that we learn so much more from our mistakes than we do from our correct answers so I want everyone to feel safe to share.

<p>Additionally, I am available everyday before school starting at 7am, everyday during life education and after school with an appointment.  At home you can send me an email with the problem you are working on and what you have so far and I will respond to you as soon as I can.</p>
		 <p>The only reason you will fail this year is if you choose to do so and even then I will be working closely with you to help change that mindset.  I am here to help you succeed but you must put in the work to do so.</p>
