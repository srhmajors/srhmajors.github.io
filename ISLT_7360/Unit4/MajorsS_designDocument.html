<h1>Sarah Majors Design Document</h1>


<h2>Data Collection</h2>
	<div class="design"></div>
<p>  I created a <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/7z1nj2JBwcZjIkLN2">questionnaire</a> on Google forms and asked middle 
and high school students and their parents to take it. I had six responses, five students and one parent. </p>

<h3>Questions asked to the group</h3>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
	<div class="design"></div>

	 <p>The purpose of this website will be to offer help and resources for my 8th grade math students and their parents. 
	 Many students struggle with math and their parents are unsure how to help them once they begin on their homework at 
	 home. I want to equip parents to help their children and provide students the resources they need to be successful. 
	 Students can also use the website to find links to other resources and games to help them increase their math abilities.  
	 </p>
	 
	 
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
	 <div class="design">

	 <ul>
<li> Students who are struggling with the math concepts and need a review of the days lesson can go to the website 
and watch a video explanation of the lesson.  The hope is that review will help them to complete their homework.    </li>

<li> Students who have free time in math class, another class or at home can use the resources and games to increase 
their math skills.  These can be used as review, enrichment, or as a way to practice/learn missing concepts.  </li>

<li> Parents can use the website to review math material with or without their child to better help them with the homework.
Parents can also use the website to check what homework was assigned and when the next assessment is. I will include links 
to both Schoology (LMS)and Infinite Campus (grades) </li>
</ul>


<h2>Design Concept</h2>
	 <div class="design">
	 
	 <ol>
<h3>	 <li>Audience</li></h3>
<div class="design"></div>

	 <p>The target audience for this website will be 8th grade math students and their parents. These students and parents
attend the Park Hill School District in Kansas City, MO.  These students and parents all have Internet access in their 
homes and the students are given a Lenovo Think Pad by the district to take back and forth from school.  Students in this 
school district have had a computer provided to them by the district since they were in the 5th grade.  The are efficient
users of the device. 	 </p>	
	 
<h3>	 <li>Reference Websites</li></h3>
<div class="design"></div>
	 
	 <p>  Below are five websites that have good and/or bad (in my opinion) features that I will consider when creating my
	 website.</p>
 <ul>
<li> I like the simpleness of this layout and color scheme (although I will use my school colors).  
<a href="http://www.yourwcs.com/~kziegenbein@yourwcs.com/middle-school-math">Williamette Christian School - 
Middle School Math</a>    </li>

<li> This is an example of what I do not want in a website.  It is too busy and cluttered.  I do like the top 
navigation though. <a href="http://mrscrenshawmath.blogspot.com/">Mrs. Crenshaw's 6th Grade Math Website</a>    </li>

<li> I like that the pictures all have the same theme on this website.  I also like that it has a very clean 
but professional look about it. <a href="http://mathwithta.weebly.com/">Algebraic</a>  </li>

<li> This is another website that I do not like.  I do not like that the font is too small to read in the navigation bar.
I do not like the color scheme and how the text has to be encapsled in white to read it.  I do not like the way the photo 
on the home page looks stretched.  I do like that there is a search bar so if you are not sure where to find something you 
can search for it. <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/vistausd.org/mrs-moynihan/home">Mrs. Moynihan Math 8</a>    </li>

<li> This website just confirms for me that I do not like the side columns on websites.  I think they look to crowded and 
overwhelming.  I want to make a website that is straight forward and simple but professional looking.  I want it to have 
all the information but not be all crammed on the page.  I do like the color scheme chosen and the white background.  The 
navigation bar font is too small. <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/vistausd.org/jessica-sensenbaugh/home">Mrs. 
Sensenbaugh's Classroom</a>    </li>
</ul>
	 </ol>
	 
	 
<h2>Presentation Information</h2>
	 <div class="design">	 
	 
<ol>	 

<li><h3>Content Synopsis</h3>
	<div class="design"></div>	</li>

<p>Based off of the information received from my survey, I have decided to include the following content areas on my 
website.
</p>
	<ul>
	<li>A <b>home page</b> that gives information about the class, the curriculum, my expectations and contact information.  
	I will also list the links for Schoology and Infinite Campus on the home page.</li>
	<li>A <b>resources page</b> with links to other websites that students would find useful</li>
	<li>A <b>review page</b> that explains how to study for tests with review material</li>
	<li>A <b>homework page</b> with the daily homework and upcoming assessments</li>
	<li>A <b>games page</b> where students can go to review material or practice basic facts</li>
	</ul>
	
<li><h3>Text Outline of Website Organization</h3>
	<div class="design"></div>	</li>	


<h4>The <b>home page</b></h4>
<div class="design"></div>
<ul>
	<li>A link to the <a href="https://www.parkhill.k12.mo.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_62416/File/Academic%20Services/Board%20Approved%20Curriculum/6-12%20Mathematics/Revisions%20Spring%202017/8thGradeMathematics--Board%20Approved%20May%2011,%202017.pdf">8th grade math curriculum</a></li>
	<li>General information about 8th grade math, such as what topics we will cover, supplies needed (spiral notebook, 
	writing utensil and your laptop) and class expectations </li>
	<li>Links to <a href="https://schoology.parkhill.k12.mo.us/home/">Schoology</a> and 
		<a href="https://ic.parkhill.k12.mo.us/">Infinite Campus</a>
	<li>Contact information and office hours</li>
</ul>
 <p> Additionally, I would say that 8th grade math will prepare you for Algebra 1A in high school.  It is a much more 
 rigorous curriculum than 7th grade.  You will have homework almost every night.  We will spend the first few days getting 
 to know each other and building a community of math learners.  It is important to me to create a safe learning environment 
 for all students as we will be making a lot of mistakes as we learn.  I will reinforce the fact that we learn so much more 
 from our mistakes than we do from our correct answers so I want everyone to feel safe to share. </p>
 <p> I would also want to include this quote:</p>
 
 <blockquote><em>"We learn wisdom from failure much more than from success. We often discover what will do, by finding 
 out what will not do; and probably he who never made a mistake never made a discovery” ― Samuel Smiles, The Lives of 
 George and Robert Stephenson</em></blockquote>
 
<h4>The <b>resources page</b></h4>
<div class="design"></div>
<ul>
		<li>Links to <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, 
		<a href="https://www.prodigygame.com/">Prodigy</a> and <a href="https://www.ixl.com/signin/lake">IXL</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, I will add that I am available every day before school starting at 7am, every day during life education 
and after school with an appointment.  At home you can send me an email with the problem you are working on and what you 
have so far and I will respond to you as soon as I can.</p>
<p>The only reason you will fail this year is if you choose to do so and even then I will be working closely with you to 
help change that mindset.  I am here to help you succeed but you must put in the work to do so.</p>

<h4>The <b>review page</b></h4>
<div class="design"></div>
<p>On this page I want to discuss with students how to review for a test and where to go to find the information.  Many
8th grade students are completely reliant on the teacher to give them review material that they do not know how to review
on their own or where to look for their own review material.  As these students are getting closer and closer to entering
high school and eventually college they need to be equipped with these tools.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I will include resources about effective ways to study (flash cards, review notes, watch lesson videos, go over homework
	problems that were missed, go through the textbook, etc) </li>
	<li>I will include links to websites that include tips on how to study</li>
</ul>

<h4>The <b>homework page</b></h4>
<div class="design"></div>

<p> I will include a table on this page with columns listing the date, homework assignment, link to video lesson and due
date.  Additionally I will list any upcoming assessments.  </p>

<h4>The <b>games page</b></h4>
<div class="design"></div>
<p> I will include links to the following games/websites for the students to use during any free time. I will also mention
that they should not be playing any of these games without a teacher's permission or if they have any homework or classwork
that needs to be completed.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://xtramath.org/#/home/index">Xtra Math</a></li>

	<li><a href="https://www.arcademics.com/">Arcademics</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://gregtangmath.com/games.html?game=tf">Greg Tang Math Games</a></li>
	
	<li><a href="https://solveme.edc.org/Mobiles.html">Solve Me Mobiles</a></li>

</ul>



<li><h3>Wireframe of Website Organization</h3>
	<div class="design"></div>	</li>
	
<p>
</p>

<li><h3>Rationale for Organization</h3>
	<div class="design"></div>	</li>
	
<p>To provide a consistent look and feel each page of my website will include the same banner at the top of each page, the 
same navigation and color scheme for each page, contact information at the bottom of each page and a link back to the home 
page.  I plan for each page to be simple, yet have all the information needed easily available.  
</p>


<li><h3>Media</h3>
	<div class="design"></div>	</li>
	
<p>
</p>

<li><h3>Color Scheme and Rationale</h3>
	<div class="design"></div>	</li>
<p> I want to my site to have some color but not be overwhelming. I changed from my very basic purple, grey and white color 
scheme after receiving feedback from my survey.  Those who responded wanted more of a fun color scheme.  I do not want it
to be too distracting from the content on the page so I think these colors are a nice compromise. </p>

<p><img src="srhmajors.github.io/ISLT_7360/Unit4/Unit4Images/color scheme.jpg" alt="color scheme"></p>
 
<p>I tested all of my colors through <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">Web Aim's</a> color contrast 
checker and they all passed.</p>
