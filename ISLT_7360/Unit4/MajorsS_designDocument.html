<h1>Sarah Majors Design Document</h1>


<h2>Data Collection</h2>
	<div class="design"></div>
<p>  I created a <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/7z1nj2JBwcZjIkLN2">questionnaire</a> on Google forms and asked middle 
and high school students and their parents to take it.  </p>

<h3>Questions asked to the group</h3>
	<div class="design"></div>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
	<div class="design"></div>

	 <p>The purpose of this website will be to offer help and resources for my 8th grade math students and their parents. 
	 Many students struggle with math and their parents are unsure how to help them once they begin on their homework at 
	 home. I want to equip parents to help their children and provide students the resources they need to be successful. 
	 Students can also use the website to find links to other resources and games to help them increase their math abilities.  
	 </p>
	 
	 
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
	 <div class="design">

	 <ul>
<li> Students who are struggling with the math concepts and need a review of the days lesson can go to the website 
and watch a video explanation of the lesson.  The hope is that review will help them to complete their homework.    </li>

<li> Students who have free time in math class, another class or at home can use the resources and games to increase 
their math skills.  These can be used as review, enrichment, or as a way to practice/learn missing concepts.  </li>

<li> Parents can use the website to review math material with or without their child to better help them with the homework.
Parents can also use the website to check what homework was assigned and when the next assessment is.  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Design Concept</h2>
	 <div class="design">
	 
	 <ol>
	 <li>Audience</li>

	 <p>The target audience for this website will be 8th grade math students and their parents. These students and parents
attend the Park Hill School District in Kansas City, MO.  These students and parents all have Internet access in their 
homes and the students are given a Lenovo Think Pad by the district to take back and forth from school.  Students in this 
school district have had a computer provided to them by the district since they were in the 5th grade.  The are efficient
users of the device. 	 </p>	
	 
	 <li>Reference Websites</li>
	 
	 <p>  Below are five websites that have good and/or bad (in my opinion) features that I will consider when creating my
	 website.</p>
 <ul>
<li> I like the simpleness of this layout and color scheme (although I will use my school colors).  
<a href="http://www.yourwcs.com/~kziegenbein@yourwcs.com/middle-school-math">Williamette Christian School - 
Middle School Math</a>    </li>

<li> This is an example of what I do not want in a website.  It is too busy and cluttered.  I do like the top 
navigation though. <a href="http://mrscrenshawmath.blogspot.com/">Mrs. Crenshaw's 6th Grade Math Website</a>    </li>

<li> I like that the pictures all have the same theme on this website.  I also like that it has a very clean 
but professional look about it. <a href="http://mathwithta.weebly.com/">Algebraic</a>  </li>

<li> This is another website that I do not like.  I do not like that the font is too small to read in the navigation bar.
I do not like the color scheme and how the text has to be encapsled in white to read it.  I do not like the way the photo 
on the home page looks stretched.  I do like that there is a search bar so if you are not sure where to find something you 
can search for it. <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/vistausd.org/mrs-moynihan/home">Mrs. Moynihan Math 8</a>    </li>

<li> This website just confirms for me that I do not like the side columns on websites.  I think they look to crowded and 
overwhelming.  I want to make a website that is straight forward and simple but professional looking.  I want it to have 
all the information but not be all crammed on the page.  I do like the color scheme chosen and the white background.  The 
navigation bar font is too small. <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/vistausd.org/jessica-sensenbaugh/home">Mrs. 
Sensenbaugh's Classroom</a>    </li>
</ul>

		 <p> I look forward to learning with you this year as we explore the <a href="https://www.parkhill.k12.mo.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_62416/File/Academic%20Services/Board%20Approved%20Curriculum/6-12%20Mathematics/Revisions%20Spring%202017/8thGradeMathematics--Board%20Approved%20May%2011,%202017.pdf">8th grade math curriculum</a>. You will need a spiral notebook, pencil and your laptop for every class.  8th grade math will prepare you for Algebra 1A in high school.  It is a much more rigorous curriculum than 7th grade.  You will have homework almost every night.  We will spend the first few days getting to know each other and building a community of math learners.  It is important to me to create a safe learning environment for all students as we will be making a lot of mistakes as we learn.  I will reinforce the fact that we learn so much more from our mistakes than we do from our correct answers so I want everyone to feel safe to share.

<h2>Math Resources</h2>
	 <div class="design">

	 <p>Below is a list of resources to help you if you struggle and would like additional help.  </p>
		 <ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.prodigygame.com/">Prodigy</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.ixl.com/signin/lake">IXL</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, I am available every day before school starting at 7am, every day during life education and after school with an appointment.  At home you can send me an email with the problem you are working on and what you have so far and I will respond to you as soon as I can.</p>
		 <p>The only reason you will fail this year is if you choose to do so and even then I will be working closely with you to help change that mindset.  I am here to help you succeed but you must put in the work to do so.</p>
